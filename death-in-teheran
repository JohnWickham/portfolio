		<p>&ldquo;Death in Teheran&rdquo;</p>
	
		<p>A rich and mighty Persian once walked in his garden with one of his servants. The servant cried that he had just encountered Death, who had threatened him. He begged his master to give him his fastest horse so that he could make haste and flee to Teheran, which he could reach that same evening. The master consented, and the servant galloped off on the horse.</p>
		
		<p>On returning to his house, the master himself met Death, and questioned him, &ldquo;Why did you terrify and threaten my servant?&rdquo;</p>
		
		<p>Death replied, &ldquo;I did not threaten him; I only showed surprise in still finding him here when I planned to meet him tonight in Teheran.&rdquo;</p>
