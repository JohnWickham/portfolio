		<p>&ldquo;If&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

		<p>If you can keep your head when all about you<br>
		&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Are losing theirs and blaming it on you,<br>
		If you can trust yourself when all men doubt you,<br>
		&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But make allowance for their doubting too;<br>
		If you can wait and not be tired by waiting,<br>
		&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Or being lied about, don’t deal in lies,<br>
		Or being hated, don’t give way to hating,<br>
		&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And yet don’t look too good, nor talk too wise:</p>
		
		<p>If you can dream—and not make dreams your master;<br>
		&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If you can think—and not make thoughts your aim;<br>
		If you can meet with Triumph and Disaster<br>
		&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And treat those two impostors just the same;<br>
		If you can bear to hear the truth you’ve spoken<br>
		&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Twisted by knaves to make a trap for fools,<br>
		Or watch the things you gave your life to, broken,<br>
		&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And stoop and build ’em up with worn-out tools:</p>
		
		<p>If you can make one heap of all your winnings<br>
		&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And risk it on one turn of pitch-and-toss,<br>
		And lose, and start again at your beginnings<br>
		&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And never breathe a word about your loss;<br>
		If you can force your heart and nerve and sinew<br>
		&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To serve your turn long after they are gone,<br> 
		And so hold on when there is nothing in you<br>
		&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Except the Will which says to them: &lsquo;Hold on!&lsquo;</p>
		
		<p>If you can talk with crowds and keep your virtue,<br>  
		&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Or walk with Kings—nor lose the common touch,<br> 
		If neither foes nor loving friends can hurt you,<br> 
		&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If all men count with you, but none too much;<br> 
		If you can fill the unforgiving minute<br> 
		&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With sixty seconds’ worth of distance run,<br>  
		Yours is the Earth and everything that’s in it,<br>
		&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And—which is more—you’ll be a Man, my son!</p>
		&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
		<p>Rudyard Kipling, from &ldquo;Rewards and Fairies&rdquo;</p>
